        <p>We got our start in a small shop in downtown Seattle during the spring season. Now, we currently have more than 60 locations all across the states! We take great pride in working with local artists, and helping them establish names for themselves. We are currently looking to expand our business into hosting live music and cocktails on Thursdays! Weâ€™ll also be teaching classes on bouquet arrangements in the upcoming future.
